Introduction
************
 
The Software Factory (SWF) concept is intended to be used as a structured way
to set up a platform, and to be a handbook for the work involved in the
development of that platform. Part of this concept is to enable a project to
start creating and populating its own SWF - a handbook specific to the needs
of the project.

The project SWF starts with initial and basic content, at the same time as the
platform is in an initial basic state, and then evolves into a project specific
SWF as the platform evolves as well. This evolution is expected to correlate
with the maturity and progress of the project. In essence, this means the SWF
intends to quickly start a project's development of a platform and also guide
the project into maturity.
